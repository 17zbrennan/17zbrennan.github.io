		<h2>Bearhand Bill & Java Maze Build</h2>
		<p class="information">
			Both of these projects are programs that I am very proud of and wish to share. However, as time goes on, things tend to break. This is the case for both of these projects. Bearhand billâ€™s main issue as of now is that it was made in Action Script and Flash. It has been a challenge opening it due to flash being deprecated in 2020. The java maze seems to either have broken or I just can't get it to function properly at this time. I am still proud of these projects, so I wish to explain what they were at the very least. 
			<br>
			Bearhand Bill was a game created in actionscript. This game gave an isometric view of the character, Bill, who had 	bear hands. The main gameplay features of this game was the movement, the shooting, and the reloading. Due to this being built in actionscript 3.0, most of the gameplay mechanics and features had to be programmed by hand. 
			<br>
			The Java Maze Builder was created using Java. This program would create randomly generated mazes via an array. It would then place a start and end point for it to find. It accomplished this in two different ways. It would either use a stack, which would be an extremely inefficient way to do so, or it would use a queue. When it used the queue it would find the best path possible.
