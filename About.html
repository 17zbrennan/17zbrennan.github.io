	      <p class="information">

			Hello, I am Zachary Brennan. I am a recent graduate and current Alumni of the Pennsylvania College of Technology. At this college, I pursued an education in Gaming and Simulation. This major focuses on programming games and general programming knowledge. Other information that I accumulated would be Game Design Concepts, Mathematical Skills, and other general Information Technology knowledge.
			<br><br>
			When it comes to my hobbies, gaming is definitely my favorite activity to do. Some of my favorite games would be Genshin Impact, Dark Souls and Diablo III. I have been playing games for over a decade and have always loved the level of detail developers put into their games. One of my favorite aspects of game development is the creation of the world and the lore behind it. This has drawn me to this industry and has made me extremely hopeful for the future. Other things I enjoy outside of video game development would be some sports and watching shows.  
			<br><br>
			When trying to describe my general personality, I would probably bring up my hardworking attitude and my attention to detail. If a job is put in front of me, it will be completed in a timely manner and will be the best work I can produce. I find being accountable and proud of your work will usually leave people satisfied. Other aspects I would like to mention would be my kindness and respect for others. Everyone deserves respect and should be allowed to flourish in life.
